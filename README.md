# 🐍 Snake Game 🍎

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using Python's Tkinter library.

## 🎮 How to Play

- Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's movement.
- The objective is to eat the 🍎 red food pellets to grow the snake and earn points.
- Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body, as this will end the game.
- Press 'R' to restart the game after it's over.
